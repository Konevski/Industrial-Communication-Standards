# Ethernet/TTEthernet
## We miss you Wiktor, come to the lecture. You are the most valuable asset we have
## Italy is the best country in the world. 
## Preliminary Sketch:

### Part I – Wiktor Kochanek
1.	7 Layer Model
-	What is does the model represent in general and what is the physical layer specifically? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCuyS7ihr_E&ab_channel=danscourses (most relevant after 13:20)
-	What is ethernet in the most basic sense
-	How useful and safe it is compared to Wi-Fi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUAv2fiIr3c&ab_channel=Datheavyguy 
-	History of ethernet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5MezxMcRmk&ab_channel=GideonRoberts
https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ethernet#/History 
https://www.comms-express.com/blog/what-does-an-ethernet-cable-do/#:~:text=The%20most%20common%20use%20for,or%20a%20network%20to%20work. 
2.	Where is it used (or why is it relevant in the first place)
-	https://transmitter.ieee.org/ethernet-hyper-connected-world/ 
-	more sources will be added eventually, as this is the most important topic in this specific part

========================================================================================

### Part II – Gordan Konevski
- **Main source**: 
https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/EE-269.pdf 
-	This will be the main connection between the first and the second part. It will deal with the technicalities and components of ethernet and will introduce some example code. As such, it will go in great depths to describe the innerworkings of what makes ethernet such a relevant component of networking in general. The make-up of the topics and their chronology will be reworked and reordered as the final paper is being drafted.

1.	What is TTEthernet
-	No technicalities necessary, just a lay man’s explanation of what it is
-	From Ethernet to TTEthernet
2.	TTEthernet Design Objectives
3.	Four possible scenarios
